## Keras Hyperparameter Optimization

- The main file with all the methods and comments is **Pfeifer_Daniel_Deep_Learning_HW5_hyperopt.ipynb**.
- The **Pfeifer_Daniel_Deep_Learning_HW5_base.ipynb** file only contains the first half: *data()* and *create_model()* functions that was needed for Hyperopt to run. However, these are also contained in the first file.
- Finally, **pfeifer_daniel_hw5_hyperas-cifar10-log.csv** is the Hpyeropt log file that contains all the tested parameters.
